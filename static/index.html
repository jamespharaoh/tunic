		This page contains my notes from deciphering the alphabet used in the game
		<a href="https://tunicgame.com/">Tunic</a>. This page has a list of the different
		consonants and vowels which are combined to form a complete character, and some other
		notes and information. There's a list of <a href="words">common words</a>, and I also made
		a list of <a href="names">common names</a>.

	<h2>Notes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			I currently show the words without the gap in the middle used in the game. I see this
			as a stylistic difference and that I am simply using a different, more basic font. In
			the future I might implement different fonts.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Vowels</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Speakers with an American accent will normally pronounce what I have written as "a" or
			"ɑ" with a "æ" sound. I use "a" for simplicity and because it should be easily
			understood by anyone. Furthermore, speakers with a British accent will often vary in
			their usage of "ɑ" and "a", depending on accent. None of this affects the spelling in
			Tunic's alphabet, in any case.
		</li>
		<li>
			Many words are spelt with the vowel sound "ʊ" in the game, ie the vowel sound from the
			word "look". This often appears after a "d" sound and before an "l" or "n" sound.
			Dictionaries, however, use an "ə" or omit the sound entirely. While I think the
			dictionary version is better, I think it would be hard to hear the difference, and I
			suspect speakers with some accents actually pronounce it more like this sound anyway.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are a few other words with unusual vowel sounds, for example "swamp". I have not
			tried to use the correct phonetic letter for these rare cases, and just picked a
			similar sound which matches the sound used by the game.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Native speaker versions</h3>

	<p>
		There are a number of words which are spelt in a way which doesn't seem to match the
		pronunciation found in the dictionary. Where this is the case, and if I think the
		pronunciation would be extremely unusual for a native speaker, then I have marked these
		words with "as written in game", and also included my own version marked with "native
		pronunciation". Most of these are instances of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			There are many examples of "ɪ", often before an "n", where the dictionary and most
			native speakers would omit the sound or use a neutral sound like "ə".
		</li>
		<li>
			There are several words spelt with a long "i" sound where the dictionary or a native
			speaker would use a short "ɪ", often in words which start with "e" or "re". The "i"
			sound is generally understood to mean the same thing, and may even be used by a native
			speaker for emphasis, but I don't think it is how these words would be spelt
			phonetically in a printed document.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Contact</h3>

	<p>
		These are basically just my own notes, which have been cleaned up a bit and made to look a
		bit nicer. I made my notes this way because my original scrawled ones were horrendous, and
		it didn't take me long to build something to make them look nicer on the computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm sure there are loads of mistakes, and there's plenty more I'd like to work on,
		especially how to deal with the discrepancies I've found, such as the frequent use of "ɪ"
		instead of "ə". So please send any comments or suggestions for improval.
