	<h2>Notes</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			I currently show the words without the gap in the middle used in the game. I see this
			as a stylistic difference and that I am simply using a different, more basic font. In
			the future I might implement different fonts.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Vowels</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			What is shown as "a" here actually covers several sounds, including "æ" and "ɑ". Usage
			of these sounds also varies a lot based on accent; for example "can't" would typically
			be pronounced with "ɑ" or "a" in the UK and "æ" in the United States. For simplicity,
			I just use the latin "a".
		</li>
		<li>
			Many words are spelt with "ʊ" in the game, often after a "d" and before an "l" or "n",
			where dictionaries would generally use an "ə" or omit the phoneme entirely. I actually
			think if you omit the vowel it sounds like a very short "ʊ" because of the mouth
			position required to pronounce the consonant. (Note that when I say they are spelt
			with "ʊ" I mean that it is written the same way as, for example, the vowel in "look",
			so I assume this is the intended sound.)
		</li>
		<li>
			There are a few other words with unusual vowel sounds, for example "swamp". I have not
			listed these anywhere.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Native speaker versions</h3>

	<p>
		There are a number of words which are spelt in a way which doesn't seem to match the
		pronunciation found in the dictionary. Where this is the case, and if I think the
		pronunciation would be extremely unusual for a native speaker, then I have marked these
		words with "as written in game", and also included my own version marked with "native
		pronunciation". Most of these are instances of the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			There are many examples of "ɪ", often before an "n", where the dictionary and most
			native speakers would omit the sound or use a neutral sound like "ə".
		</li>
		<li>
			There are several words spelt with a long "i" sound where the dictionary or a native
			speaker would use a short "ɪ", often in words which start with "e" or "re". The "i"
			sound is generally understood to mean the same thing, and may even be used by a native
			speaker for emphasis, but I don't think it is how these words would be spelt
			phonetically in a printed document.
		</li>
	</ul>
